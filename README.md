# Sentiment-pro
In this project, I have used two different sentiment analysis models: NLTK's VADER and Huggingface's Roberta Transformers.

NLTK's VADER is a rule-based sentiment analyzer that uses a lexicon of words to determine the sentiment of a text. Roberta Transformers is a deep learning model that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text. Both models have their own strengths and weaknesses, so I have compared their performance on the Amazon customer reviews dataset.

The ðŸ¤— (Hugging Face) library provides some great open-source models for NLP. These models are trained on large datasets of text and code, and they can be used for a variety of tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.

In this project, I have used the ðŸ¤— library to load the Roberta Transformers model. I have then use this model to classify the sentiment of the Amazon customer reviews dataset.
